Presented task does not have solution (problem is infeasible),
since each link has capacity 5 while h[d] is 10 for each of d.

As an example, in order 2, target node is 8, it's not possible to transfer
volume 10 through this node.

Change capacity at file model.mod to at least 10 to see the results.
